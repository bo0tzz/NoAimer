# No Aimer for Peglin

This is a mod for the Peglin Demo that removes the aimer. You can also do this (and more) with the [PeglinTweaks](https://github.com/bo0tzz/PeglinTweaks) mod.

This mod is imperfect and comes with no warranties. It may break your game,
prevent you from creating new savefiles, crash your computer, or set your house on fire.

## Installation guide
1. Install the BepInEx modloader according to [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html)
2. Download the NoAimer.dll file [from the latest release](https://github.com/bo0tzz/NoAimer/releases/latest)
3. Place NoAimer.dll in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder, inside the game folder

Enjoy :)
